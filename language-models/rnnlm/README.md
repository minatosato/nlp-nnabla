# Recurrent Neural Network Language Model
## Overview
This is implementation of a vanilla recurrent neural network language model.

## Start training
This example demonstrates the training for PTB dataset.

```
python train.py
```

If you want to use cuDNN, execute as follows

```
python train.py -c cudnn
```
